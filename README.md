# ticket_bot_example
[This code is ticket bot exmple]</br>
This code has three events</br>
First is on_message for commend to make ticket channel</br>
Second is on_raw_reaction_add for add emoji to make ticket channel</br>
(I use on_raw_reaction_add (not on_reaction_add). This is because on_raw_reaction_add can see the emoji addition of uncached messages.)</br>
Third is on_error for debugging</br>
